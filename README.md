# usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. And then, run `python3 main.py` to use it!

# note
I made this mostly to practice web scraping. *I hope nobody's actually going to use this, as it's just feeding propaganda and things you shouldn't even care about directly into your brain...*
